# Fashion-Recommendation-System
This project presents a Fashion Recommendation System that leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, to provide tailored fashion suggestions to users. Built using Python and integrated with the Streamlit framework.
The system begins by collecting and preprocessing a comprehensive dataset of fashion images, encompassing various styles, categories, and brands. A convolutional neural network is then employed to extract intricate features from these images, capturing both global and local characteristics. 
Transfer learning techniques are applied, utilizing pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet to benefit from learned features and accelerate convergence. This approach ensures efficient training even with limited data and computational resources.
The core functionality of this project is, it will generate output recommendations which are similar to a given input image
In conclusion, the "Fashion Recommendation System" project demonstrates the successful fusion of Python, machine learning, convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, and the Streamlit framework to create an interactive and personalized fashion recommendation solution.

Technology used:<br/> 
User Interface:<br/>   
I have used streamlit framework for make user interface. It is very good option to develop a UI faster for data science project.<br/>
Model:<br/>
I have used transfer learning concept in this project so I have used pre-trained model called RESNET(Residual Neural Network) which have used data from Imagenet dataset. And for recommendation purpose I have used KNearest Neighbors which will search the nearest 5 recommendations to the given input image and show the output image.<br/>
